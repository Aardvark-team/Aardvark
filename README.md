# Aardvark-py Version 1.0 Test 1
This first implementation of Aardvark is written in Python. 
This is an interpreted language meant to be easy and extensible.
The real version will be compiled. You can see our progress on development in the Aardvark Compiler folder.

## Using the command
Run `adk help` in the terminal to get help.

I recomend running `adk run main.adk`.
That will let you try the `main.adk` example file.

## Documentation
This site will give basic info on how to use the language: [Click Here](https://Aardvark-Docs.programit.repl.co).
