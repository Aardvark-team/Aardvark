# Aardvark-py Version 1.0 Test 1
First implementation of Aardvark, written in python. 
This is a interpretted language meant to be easy and extensible.

## Using the command
Run `./adk help` in the terminal to get help.

I recomend running `./adk run main.adk`.
That will let you try the `main.adk` example file.

## Documentation
This site will give basic info on how to use the language: [Click Here](https://Aardvark-Docs.programit.repl.co).
