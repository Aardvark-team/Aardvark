The `adk` command, tests, and some libs currently use absolute paths to work, so they only work within the Replit file structure for now.
Or run code here: [https://adkcode.programit.repl.co](https://adkcode.programit.repl.co)
NOTE: for security reasons, some Aardvark features (such as `open`) are unavailable in AdkCode.

# Aardvark-py Version 1.0 Test 1
This first implementation of Aardvark is written in Python. 
This is an interpreted language meant to be easy and extensible.
The real version will be compiled. You can see our progress on development in the Aardvark Compiler folder.

## Using the command
Run `adk help` in the terminal to get help.

I recomend running `adk run main.adk`.
That will let you try the `main.adk` example file.

## Documentation
This site will give basic info on how to use the language: [Click Here](https://Aardvark-Docs.programit.repl.co).
