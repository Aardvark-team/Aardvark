# About Aardvark

Aardvark was first created in late 2020, but it has changed a lot since then. 
Our team has worked on it on and off since, and the team has changed a lot too.

Aardvark was designed to be easy yet powerful. With syntax similar to that of Python and JavaScript, its easy for anyone who has prior programming experience. With easily understandable keywords and syntax, its also easy for new programmers.
